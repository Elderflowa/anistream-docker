# AnilistStream-docker  
### A self-hosted Stremio addon for HTTP anime streaming

**AnilistStream-docker** is a fork of the AnilistStream Stremio addon that provides **HTTP-based anime streaming** (not torrents), with AniList integration for metadata and watch progress synchronization.

This fork exists to enable **self-hosting on your own hardware**, rather than relying on the public hosted server.
